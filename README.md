This is the README for your project. It is intended to give details about
**internal implementation** of your code, either for your **teammates**
or for the purposes of **sharing**. It **will not** be displayed in your
[Standard Library](https://stdlib.com/) documentation.

You can include an **Deploy on Standard Library** button for GitHub,
as displayed above.
